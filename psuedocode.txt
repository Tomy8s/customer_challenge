Pseudo-code:

QuestionA

For each row from table
	select row and call it x
	Until second last row
		Select following row and call it y
		if (
			product x equals product y and 
			customer x equals customer y and 
			measure x equals measure y and (
			(valid from day x is after valid from day y and before valid to day y) or 
			(valid to day x is after valid from day y and before valid to day y) or
			(valid from day x is before valid from day y and valid to day x is after valid to day y) or
			(valid from day y is after valid from day x and before valid to day x) or
			(valid to day y is after valid from day x and before valid to day x) or
			(valid from day y is before valid from day x and valid to day y is after valid to day x)
		) then
			mark x as overlapping with y
			mark y as overlapping with x
		full stop for if.
	full stop for until.
full stop for for.

QuestionB

For each row marked as overlapping
	if ((valid from day y is before valid from day x) and (valid to day y is before valid to day x)) then
		change valid to day y to the day before valid from day x
	else if (valid from day y is before valid from day x) then
		x is completely overlapped and can be removed
	else if ((valid from day x is before valid from day y) and (valid to day x is before valid to day y)) then
		change valid to day x to the day before valid from day y
	else if (valid from day x is before valid from day y) then
		y is completely overlapped and can be removed
	full stop for if
full stop for for.

QuestionC

This assumes exact matches for product, customer and measure.
This assumes understandably formatted dates are given.
This assumes valid from dates precede valid to dates of the respective item.
this ignores differences in values for overlapping days
This completely removes data when a product is completely overlapped.
